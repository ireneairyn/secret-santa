                Secret Santa, known as
                <em> amigo invisible (invisible friend)</em> in Spanish, is a
                gift-giving tradition where members of a group are randomly
                assigned to give a gift to one person without revealing their
                identity until the gift is opened.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ok, now that you know what it is, you are ready to play. What do
                you need?
              </p>
              <p>
                Generous people that want to spend money on someone they might
                not know very well in exchange for a present they probably don't
                like.
              </p>
              <p>
                I know, I'm not selling it very well so far, BUT that's not
                going to happen this time!
              </p>
              <p>Here's what you have to do:</p>
            </div>
          )}
        </div>
        <div className={styles.how}>
          <h2>How to play</h2>
          <p>
            In six words:
            <strong> name | email | exceptions | budget | date | time</strong>
          </p>
          <div className={styles.displayButton}>
          <button onClick={handleButtonClick2}>{showExtendedText2 ? "I need less" : "I need more"}</button>

          </div>
          {showExtendedText2 && (
            <div className={styles.whatExtended}>
            <p>
              Write the name and email of the participants, including yours as
              the organiser. Next to each participant choose the name or names
              of those they shouldn't give a gift to.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example: Sara, Sam, Elena, Daniel, Alex and Nico are playing,
              but Sam and Nico are a couple so they don't want to give a present
              to each other as part of this game, You would add the exception
              next to one of their names and will guarantee they'll give and get
              a present from other people.
            </p>
            <p>Once that's sorted, choose a budget for the presents.</p>
            <p>Finally, add a date and place for the event!</p>
